Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning..........................................................................................................................................

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual has heart disease, based on various medical and demographic features. 
We will be using popular machine learning libraries in Python, such as Scikit-learn and Pandas, to build and evaluate the model.

Tasks....................................................................................................................................................................................

Developed a predictive machine learning model to diagnose heart disease, utilizing Python libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas, 
achieving high accuracy in classification based on demographic and medical data.

Performed comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection, applying techniques like correlation analysis and 
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting.

Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) and optimized models using cross-validation, 
precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics to ensure reliable predictions for heart disease detection.

Results for Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning...............................................................................................................................

The results from the analysis show the following performance for two different models:

Logistic Regression: The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 80%. This indicates that the model correctly predicted the outcome 80% of the time, 
suggesting a good level of predictive performance. However, there may still be some room for improvement in terms of precision and model tuning.

Decision Tree: The decision tree model achieved a perfect accuracy of 1.00, meaning it correctly predicted all outcomes. 
While this indicates excellent performance on the given dataset, it may also raise concerns about potential overfitting. 
The model could have learned the noise or specific characteristics of the training data, making it less generalizable to new, unseen data.
